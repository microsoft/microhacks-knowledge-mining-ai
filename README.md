# Microhack - Knowledge Mining AI
Hands-on Microhack created by Microsoft Office of the CTO Americas, focused on Agentic AI.

## Presented by Microsoft Americas Office of the CTO

Originally from [Conversation Knowledge Mining Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Conversation-Knowledge-Mining-Solution-Accelerator) repository.


## Microhack Oveview

Meet Alex, an analyst at Contoso, Ltd., a leading company in the tech industry. Contoso, Ltd. prides itself on delivering exceptional customer experiences, but they are facing a significant business challenge. The company has been receiving an overwhelming amount of conversational data from various sources, including customer interactions, support tickets, and social media channels. This data holds valuable insights that could help Contoso, Ltd. understand customer sentiment, identify emerging trends, and make strategic decisions to drive growth. However, the sheer volume of data is making it nearly impossible for Alex to extract meaningful insights quickly and efficiently.

 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

<br/>

### Prerequisites and costs
To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

Pricing varies by region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, some services—such as Azure Container Registry, which has a fixed cost per registry per day, and others like Cosmos DB or SQL Database when provisioned—may incur baseline charges regardless of actual usage.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/67c83432524440d98ccb8c92ebd3e2f7) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

<br/>

Analysts often work with large volumes of unstructured conversational data, making it difficult to extract actionable insights quickly and accurately. Traditional tools limit interaction with data, making it hard to surface patterns or ask the right follow-up questions without extensive manual exploration.

This solution addresses those challenges by enabling natural language interaction, dynamic data exploration, and contextual visualization. Analysts can identify key themes, clarify findings, and act with greater confidence—all within a streamlined, insight-driven experience.

⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Security guidelines

This solution uses [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to securely store secrets, connection strings, and API keys required by application components.

It also leverages [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for secure access to Azure resources during local development and production deployment, eliminating the need for hard-coded credentials.

To maintain strong security practices, it is recommended that GitHub repositories built on this solution enable [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) to detect accidental secret exposure.

Additional security considerations include:

- Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud) to monitor and secure Azure resources.
- Using [Virtual Networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli) or [firewall rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) to protect Azure Container Apps from unauthorized access.
